              <h3>About me</h3>
              <p>I've lived in Lewiston, Idaho for all 23 years of my life, and hope
                 to explore as much of the world as possible. In the meantime, I'm a
                 student in Math and Computer Science at Lewis-Clark State College,
                 and a soon-to-be graduate. Though I will be out of school soon,
                 I still hope to continue my education in areas like web design
                 and development, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
                 and programming language design.

              <h3>Who I've worked for</h3>
              <p>Since nobody will pay me to be a perpetual student, I have to
                 earn income. Here's where I've worked:
              </p>

                  <h4>Schweitzer Engineering Labs</h4>
                  <h5>Software Engineering Intern</h5>

                <p>
                  Here, I have had the opportunity to learn about real-world
                  software development. I have developed tools in Python that
                  work with the Atlassian toolchain and made other developers'
                  lives easier. I am currently using C and C++ to refactor,
                  redesign, and simplify a tool used by the manufacturing
                  department.
