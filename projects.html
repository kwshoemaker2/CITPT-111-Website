              <h3 class="project-title">Lewis-Clark State College iOS App</h3>
              <p>I developed this app with a team of other students for both my
                 Software Engineering and as part of my Capstone Design class.</p>
              <p>The Lewis-Clark State College iOS app provides students access
                 to all the resources they need at the college. Through the app,
                 students can access their student email, WarriorOne card, athletics
                 livestream broadcasts, the KLCZ radio, and the college social media
                 accounts. The app also features an event calendar that shows all the
                 upcoming events on campus. Additionally, the students can add these
                 events to their phone's calendar if they so desire.
              </p>
              <p>I mainly developed the front and back ends of the campus event calendar
                 using Objective-C. For my Capstone Design class, I also had to update
                 the app to meet new requirements and to get it working with iOS 9.

              <p>This website is my final project for my HTML and CSS class.
              </p>
              <p>The website is written in HTML and CSS without using any
                 frameworks. It features a front page that gives a quick
                 overview of my skills, a page for talking about projects
                 that I have worked on, a page that gives a more detailed
                 bio of myself, and finally a contact page for any interested
                 headhunters.</p>

              <h3 class="project-title">Lurk Client/Server Project</h3>
              <p>This was my final project for my Networking class. It features the
                 client and server implementations of a protocol my professor wrote
                 for playing a text-based <abbr title="Multi-User Dungeon">MUD</abbr>.</p>
              <p>The client is a Windows destop application that features a graphic
                 user-interface. I used C# and Windows Presentation Foundation to write
                 the client. The client is written to play on any server that implements
                 the Lurk protocol.
              </p>
              <p>The server is written in Python. It implements the portions of the
                 protocol that the client uses, and also provides the implementation
                 for the game environment itself. The environment on my server exists
                 in the Star Trek universe and features a Federation ship under attack
                 by an alien race similar to the Borg.

              <h3 class="project-title">Lorem Ipsum</h3>
              <p>This is a project for my Artificial Intelligence class. It
                 is a command-line Java application that colors maps according
                 to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem" target="_blank">Four Color Theorem</a>.
              </p>
              <p>The application inputs a text file describing the borders of
                 regions in a geographical map, and colors the regions so that
                 no two bordering regions share the same color. It performs
                 this task with the minimum number of different colors needed
                 for any given map.
              </p>
              <p>This is the first major Java project that I have worked on. On
                 the left you can see a colored version of the Pacific Northwest.
                 The circles represent the geographical regions, and the lines
                 between each correspond to a border between those regions.
